*A drupal child theme for the grid 960 system. *

This is a starting point for theme development which allows you to turn on / off the 960 grid system.

Some things that are in the works for this one:

    * Configure the 960 grid to set a 12-grid or 16 grid as visible in development mode
    * Customizable grid spacing
    * Downloadable photoshop template for the currently showing grid overlay
